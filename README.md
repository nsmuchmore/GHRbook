This is a repository for the book ["Global Health Research: Design + Methods"](http://ghr.ericpgreen.com/). This book is a work in progress. If you find errors (gasp!), please create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/ericpgreen/GHR), [email me](eric.green@duke.edu), or shame me on Twitter (@ericpgreen). I'm writing the book in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). The [`bookdown'](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package from the makers of RStudio does most of the heavy lifting to compile the book. The source code for the book is available on [Github](https://github.com/ericpgreen/GHR).
